# Paranoia's Journals

This concerns the brother of one of my friends, whose name I will withhold for the time being. We went to middle school together and were close friends. We have, however, been apart for a while, so I am not familiar with their life. I recently learned that he had a serious illness. Because I was at home at the time, I went to see him, but the one I saw was his younger brother. His younger brother welcomed me and thanked me for coming to see him. He also let me know that his older brother had recovered and had departed to look for work. He laughed as he handed me two of his brother's journals. He offered me his journals, saying they might contain information concerning his disease. His journals revealed that he suffered from paranoia. His writing used numerous odd words and was quite illogical. He didn't write the date either. Only different handwritings indicated that it had not been written all at once. Something seemed to be connected, so I gathered them and made this story for potential future medical studies. The same inaccuracy that he wrote was present in the story. I only removed the names that belonged to local people since they were unimportant. Additionally, he gave the story its name; I did not alter it. 2nd, April, 7.

## Chapter 1

The moon was particularly lovely tonight.

For thirty years, I haven't seen him. When we met today, I was beaming. It wasn't until recently that I realised I had unexamined for the previous 30 years, but I must exercise caution. Otherwise, why did Zhao's dog keep glancing over at me?

There is a cause for my fear.

## Chapter 2

No moon was visible today. This was a horrible omen, I'm sure. This morning, when I stepped outside cautiously, GuiWeng Zhao's weird expression caught my attention. He appeared to be afraid of me and to desire to hurt me. Seven or eight other people were also whispering to each other about me, but they didn't want me to hear them. People resembled them all along the streets. I was frozen from head to toe as one of the most cruel guys opened his mouth and smirked at me. I knew that their arrangement had been completed at that point.

I carried on walking my road since I wasn't afraid. A group of kids were talking about me at the front. Their look was the same as Zhao's, and their faces were deathly pale. I didn't think I had a grudge towards the kids, but he was like this. I couldn't help but yelling, "Tell me!". They escaped.

I believe that I had no grudges against Zho or the others I encountered along the way. Only 20 years ago, Mr. Gu was furious when I kicked at his old day book. Zhao didn't know Mr. Gu, but after hearing this tale, he wanted to do Mr. Gu right. Zhao therefore scheduled a meeting with those coming to harm me. What about the kids, though? They hadn't even been born yet at that point. Why did they stare at me like that, as if they were afraid of me or wanted to hurt me? This actually made me feel uneasy, puzzled, and depressed.

That's what their parents taught them, I see.

## Chapter 3

Every night, I have trouble sleeping. To understand, everything needs to be researched.

They have experienced many forms of abuse, including being bound by prefects, slapped by gentlemen, having their wives seized by government agents, and having their moms put to death by creditors. Their expression was not as frightened or vicious as it had been the day before.

The strangest thing was a woman who attacked his son on the street yesterday and threatened to bite him to relieve herself. The son was staring at me, and I couldn't help but feel shocked. All of the horrified individuals laughed together. I was hauled back home by Chen Laowu after he stepped forward.

After hauling me Back Home，My families Pretended to Not know me. Their faces were Like others. After leading me into the study，they closed the Door and bolt it, Like putting A chicken or a duck in the pen. The things made me not Understand the meaning.

A peasant from the wolf village came to report famine a few days earlier. He reported that a villain had been hit death by a crowd of people. Some of them took his heart and liver and fried them, claiming that doing so could inspire bravery in others. I murmured something, and both the peasant and my older brother looked at me. I now see that their eyes are the same as those of people outside.

After reflecting on this, I felt cold all over.

They eat people, including myself.

You see, the woman's remarks, the disgusting people's laughs, and the peasant's statements from a few days ago are all hints. I am aware of the poison in his words and the blades in his grin. Their pearly white teeth were lined up. They are the ones who eat humans.

I don't think of myself as a bad guy, but it's difficult to tell now after I've kicked off Mr. Gu's day book. They seem to think differently, and I have no idea what it means. Additionally, they may alter their minds and label someone a villain. My older brother taught me how to judge people, and I still remember that. No matter how nice a person is, if they have a disagreement, he will view him with disdain. When someone says pleasant things about a horrible individual, he will say it's an amazing improvement. How did I figure out what they were thinking? Especially if they plan on eating people.

To understand, everything needs to be researched. People used to always eat other people in the past. I remember it, although not very clearly. I opened a history book; there was no date, but justice, morality, and humanity were crookedly written into each page. I had trouble falling asleep for a while. After a half-night of investigation, I learned from the word gaps that the entire book is made up of two words: eating people!

The words written in the book and the words said by the peasant both had their eyes wide and smiled as they stared at me.

I'm a human, and they want to eat me.

## Chapter 4

This morning, I sat quietly for a bit. I received some food from Chen Laowu. A bowl of vegetables, a bowl of steamed fish . The fish's eyes were stark white and hard. It had an open mouth, similar to those guys that wanted to eat people. I ate some, it was slippery, I didn't know if it was fish or human, so I spit them all out.

I told Laowu, "Inform my older brother. I want to take a walk in the garden since I feel so congested." Laowu declined, and he then left. A little while later, he arrived and unlocked the door.

I didn't move while I looked into how they planned to tackle me. They wouldn't let it go easily, I knew. Yes, it is true! An elderly man was quietly led to me by my older brother. He looked down at the ground and peered at me through his glass frame because he didn't want me to notice his filthy eyes. You look wonderful today, my older brother said. I affirmed. My senior brother said, "I invitate Mr. Ho to see you." I affirmed. How could I have been unaware that the elderly man was a butcher? He used this as an excuse, but his true motivation was to gauge my weight. He would then be given a piece of meat as reward. I wasn't scared. I was bolder than them even though I didn't eat anybody. I reached out with two fists to see what he would do. The elderly man sat down, closed his eyes, and took a few moments to check my pulse. He opened his eyes after that and remarked, "Don't give it any thought. You will be OK if you rest for a few days."

Don't give it any thought and rest! Naturally, they ate more when I gained weight. What benefits me? How could I be fine? Those individuals desired to consume human beings but did so covertly out of fear of being caught. That almost made me laugh. I couldn't help but laugh out loud and felt relieved. I was aware that my laugh embodies courage and justice. The old man and my older brother both altered their expressions in response to my laugh.

However, the more I gained bravery, the more they wanted to eat me and absorbed my courage. The elderly man opened the door and left. He didn't go very far before whispering to my older brother, "Eat quickly!" My older brother nodded. I see you there! This fact is both unexpected and logical. My older brother had the idea to eat me with them.

My brother ate human beings!

I was the brother of a person who ate people.

Even if they ate me, I was still their brother who ate human flesh.

## Chapter 6

It's so dark. I'm unsure of the time of day. Again, Zhao's dogs are barking.

A lion's savagery, a rabbit's timidity, a fox's cunningness, ....

## Chapter 7

## Chapter 8

In actuality, they must already be aware of this truth now...

Suddenly, a man entered the room. He was in his early twenties, and his wide smile was all I could make out of his face. He gave me a nod. His grin was phoney. I questioned him, "Is eating people right?" "Except in a year of famine", he said with a smirk, "Who would desire to eat people?" I realised right away that he was with them and that he enjoyed eating people. Bravery flooded my heart, and I asked him the question.

"Is that what's right to do?"

"Why did you ask him about it? You are such a prankster. Today's weather is lovely."

The weather is lovely, and the moon is bright. However, I must ask: "Is it right?"

He muttered "No," appearing to change his mind.

"It's wrong! Why did they eat, though?"

"Nonsense."

"Nonsense? The wolf village sells freshly killed human meat. The book also states that it's entirely red and brand-new."

His face has altered; it is now like iron. "Maybe there are few, but it always goes like this", he replied while gazing at me.

"If it's always been this way, does that mean it's right?"

"I'm going to stop speaking to you. You shouldn't say this, in any case. If you asserted, That's your issue."

I instantly leaped. When I opened my eyes, the people were gone. My body was drenched in sweat. He was with them and was much younger than my older brother. He  must have been taught that by his parents. And I'm worried that his son was also taught that. That is why everyone, even kids, looks at me evilly.

## Chapter 9

Desire to eat others but fear being eaten. With intense suspicion, everyone looks at one another.

If we can put this thought aside and work, walk, eat, and sleep with ease, that will bring you great comfort. This is just a barrier or a door. They are parents, children, brothers, couples, friends, teachers, students, enemies, and strangers. Everyone congregates, supporting and impeding one another, but none wants to cross it.

## Chapter 10

## Chapter 11

## Chapter 12

I cannot think anymore.

I just realised that I had been living in a place where people have been eaten for four thousand years. My older brother was in charge of the family and my sister recently passed away. He might not have added anything to the meal and fed us quietly.

I may just mindlessly consume some of my sister's flesh, and now it's my turn.

I've been eating humans for four thousand years. Although I was unaware of it, I now realise how difficult it is to see real people.

## Chapter 13

Are there any kids who have never eaten people?

Save the kids...

April, 1918.
