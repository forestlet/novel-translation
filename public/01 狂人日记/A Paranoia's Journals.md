# A Paranoia's Journals

This concerns a brother of one of my friends, whose name I will withhold for the time being. We went to middle school together and were close friends. We have, however, been apart for a while, so I am not familiar with their life. I recently heard that he had a serious illness. Because I was at home at the time, I went to see him, but the one I saw was his younger brother. His younger brother welcomed me and thanked me for coming to see him. He also let me know that his older brother had recovered and had departed to look for work. He laughed as he handed me two of his brother's journals, saying they might contain information concerning his disease. His journals revealed that he suffered from paranoia. His writing used numerous odd words and was quite illogical. He didn't write the date either. Only different handwritings indicated that it had not been written all at once. Something seemed to be connected, so I gathered them and made this story for potential future medical studies. The same inaccuracy that he wrote was present in the story. I only removed the names that belonged to local people since they were unimportant. Additionally, he gave the story its name; I did not alter it. 2nd, April, 1918.

## Chapter 1

The moon was particularly lovely tonight.

For thirty years, I haven't seen him. When we met today, I was beaming. It wasn't until recently that I realized I had unexamined for the previous 30 years, but I must exercise caution. Otherwise, why did Cho's dog keep glancing over at me?

There is a cause for my fear.

## Chapter 2

No moon was visible today. This was a horrible omen, I'm sure. This morning, when I stepped outside cautiously, Richard Cho's weird expression caught my attention. He appeared to be afraid of me and to desire to hurt me. Seven or eight other people were also whispering to each other about me, but they didn't want me to hear them. People resembled them all along the streets. I was frozen from head to toe as one of the most cruel guys opened his mouth and smirked at me. I knew that their arrangement had been completed at that point.

I carried on walking my road since I wasn't afraid. A group of kids were talking about me at the front. Their look was the same as Cho's, and their faces were deathly pale. I didn't think I had a grudge towards the kids, but he was like this. I couldn't help but yelling, "Tell me!". They escaped.

I believe that I had no grudges against Zho or the others I encountered along the way. Only 20 years ago, Mr. Gu was furious when I kicked at his old day book. Cho didn't know Mr. Gu, but after hearing this tale, he wanted to do Mr. Gu right. Cho therefore scheduled a meeting with those coming to harm me. What about the kids, though? They hadn't even been born yet at that point. Why did they stare at me like that, as if they were afraid of me or wanted to hurt me? This actually made me feel uneasy, puzzled, and depressed.

That's what their parents taught them, I see.

## Chapter 3

Every night, I have trouble sleeping. To understand, everything needs to be researched.

They have experienced many forms of abuse, including being bound by prefects, slapped by gentlemen, having their wives seized by government agents, and having their moms put to death by creditors. Their expression was not as frightened or vicious as it had been the day before.

The strangest thing was a woman who attacked his son on the street yesterday and threatened to bite him to relieve herself. The son was staring at me, and I couldn't help but feel shocked. All of the horrified individuals laughed together. I was hauled back home by Chen Laowu after he stepped forward.

After hauling me Back Home，My families Pretended to Not know me. Their faces were Like others. After leading me into the study，they closed the Door and bolt it, Like putting A chicken or a duck in the pen. The things made me not Understand the meaning.

A peasant from the Wolf Village came to report famine a few days earlier. He reported that a villain had been hit death by a crowd of people. Some of them took his heart and liver and fried them, claiming that doing so could inspire bravery in others. I murmured something, and both the peasant and my older brother looked at me. I now see that their eyes are the same as those of people outside.

After reflecting on this, I felt cold all over.

They eat people, including myself.

You see, the woman's remarks, the disgusting people's laughs, and the peasant's statements from a few days ago are all hints. I am aware of the poison in his words and the blades in his grin. Their pearly white teeth were lined up. They are the ones who eat humans.

I don't think of myself as a bad guy, but it's difficult to tell now after I've kicked off Mr. Gu's day book. They seem to think differently, and I have no idea what it means. Additionally, they may alter their minds and label someone a villain. My older brother taught me how to judge people, and I still remember that. No matter how nice a person is, if they have a disagreement, he will view him with disdain. When someone says pleasant things about a horrible individual, he will say it's an amazing improvement. How did I figure out what they were thinking? Especially if they plan on eating people.

To understand, everything needs to be researched. People used to always eat other people in the past. I remember it, although not very clearly. I opened a history book; there was no date, but justice, morality, and humanity were crookedly written into each page. I had trouble falling asleep for a while. After a half-night of investigation, I learned from the word gaps that the entire book is made up of two words: eating people!

The words written in the book and the words said by the peasant both had their eyes wide and smiled as they stared at me.

I'm a human, and they want to eat me.

## Chapter 4

This morning, I sat quietly for a bit. I received some food from Chen Laowu. A bowl of vegetables, a bowl of steamed fish . The fish's eyes were stark white and hard. It had an open mouth, similar to those guys that wanted to eat people. I ate some, it was slippery, I didn't know if it was fish or human, so I spit them all out.

I told Laowu, "Inform my older brother. I want to take a walk in the garden since I feel so congested." Laowu declined, and he then left. A little while later, he arrived and unlocked the door.

I didn't move while I looked into how they planned to tackle me. They wouldn't let it go easily, I knew. Yes, it is true! An elderly man was quietly led to me by my older brother. He looked down at the ground and peered at me through his glass frame because he didn't want me to notice his filthy eyes. You look wonderful today, my older brother said. I affirmed. My senior brother said, "I invited Mr. Ho to see you." I affirmed. How could I have been unaware that the elderly man was a butcher? He used this as an excuse, but his true motivation was to gauge my weight. He would then be given a piece of meat as reward. I wasn't scared. I was bolder than them even though I didn't eat anybody. I reached out with two fists to see what he would do. The elderly man sat down, closed his eyes, and took a few moments to check my pulse. He opened his eyes after that and remarked, "Don't give it any thought. You will be OK if you rest for a few days."

Don't give it any thought and rest! Naturally, they ate more when I gained weight. What benefits me? How could I be fine? Those individuals desired to consume human beings but did so covertly out of fear of being caught. That almost made me laugh. I couldn't help but laugh out loud and felt relieved. I was aware that my laugh embodies courage and justice. The old man and my older brother both altered their expressions in response to my laugh.

However, the more I gained bravery, the more they wanted to eat me and absorbed my courage. The elderly man opened the door and left. He didn't go very far before whispering to my older brother, "Eat quickly!" My older brother nodded. I see you there! This fact is both unexpected and logical. My older brother had the idea to eat me with them.

My brother ate human beings!

I was the brother of a person who ate people.

Even if they ate me, I was still their brother who ate human flesh.

## Chapter 5

I was thinking back these days. What if that elderly man was actually a doctor but could also eat people? On their senior doctor Li Shizheng's book BenCao Something, written human flesh can fry and eat. How could he say that he didn't eat people?

Regarding my older brother, he is not to blame. When he told me a story about how they can alter and eat their children. The last time he talked about a bad guy, he said not should kill him but also eat his flesh and utilize his skin. I was young at the time but my heart bit fast for a while.A few days earlier, a farmer from wolf village mentioned consuming heart and liver. My older brother did not feel odd, but he nodded often. I observed that he was just as cruel as before. Since he knew altering children and eating them, he knew everything and could eat any people. I used to merely listen to his arguments, and I muddled through; Now I know when he reason, not only human oil is on his lips, but he is also thinking about eating people.

## Chapter 6

It's so dark. I'm unsure of the time of day. Again, Cho's dogs are barking.

A lion's savagery, a rabbit's timidity, a fox's cunningness, ....

## Chapter 7

I know their method. They were unwilling to kill people directly because they were terrified of the repercussions. So they got in touch and created a web to drive me to commit suicide. I can largely understand only by observing the men and ladies on the street a few days ago and the recent activities of my older brother. The ideal solution is for me to hang myself by removing my belt, hanging it on the beam. They were not charged with murder, but they did get what they wanted, so they can now laugh. Or I would pass away from anxiety and despair. Even though I was thin, I was also edible.

Only corpses are eaten by them. I recall seeing a hideous creature on the book called a hyena. Hyenas frequently devour dead meat. They  will bite and eat slowly, even from giant bones. That terrifies me. Hyenas  are related to wolves, and dogs derived from wolves. Cho's dog gave me a sideways glance the day before yesterday. I could tell he was a participant and was aware of their strategy. The elderly man looked to the ground but was unable to conceal himself from me.

My older brother was the most poor person. He was a people as well. How was he able to make them plan to eat me while remaining unfrightened? Or did he simply accept it as normal and not wrong? Or did he intentionally commit a crime after losing conscience?

If I was going to curse those who eat humans, I should start with my brother. And if I want to persuade others, I need also start from him.

## Chapter 8

In actuality, they must already be aware of this truth now...

Suddenly, a man entered the room. He was in his early twenties, and his wide smile was all I could make out of his face. He gave me a nod. His grin was phoney. I questioned him, "Is eating people right?" "Except in a year of famine", he said with a smirk, "Who would desire to eat people?" I realized right away that he was with them and that he enjoyed eating people. Bravery flooded my heart, and I asked him the question.

"Is that what's right to do?"

"Why did you ask him about it? You are such a prankster. Today's weather is lovely."

The weather is lovely, and the moon is bright. However, I must ask: "Is it right?"

He muttered "No," appearing to change his mind.

"It's wrong! Why did they eat, though?"

"Nonsense."

"Nonsense? The Wolf Village sells freshly killed human meat. The book also states that it's entirely red and brand-new."

His face has altered; it is now like iron. "Maybe there are few, but it always goes like this", he replied while gazing at me.

"If it's always been this way, does that mean it's right?"

"I'm going to stop speaking to you. You shouldn't say this, in any case. If you asserted, That's your issue."

I instantly leaped. When I opened my eyes, the people were gone. My body was drenched in sweat. He was with them and was much younger than my older brother. He  must have been taught that by his parents. And I'm worried that his son was also taught that. That is why everyone, even kids, looks at me evilly.

## Chapter 9

Desire to eat others but fear being eaten. With intense suspicion, everyone looks at one another.

If we can put this thought aside and work, walk, eat, and sleep with ease, that will bring you great comfort. This is just a barrier or a door. They are parents, children, brothers, couples, friends, teachers, students, enemies, and strangers. Everyone congregates, supporting and impeding one another, but none wants to cross it.

## Chapter 10

I went to find my older brother this morning. He stood in front of the hallway, looking up at the sky. I approached his back and blocked the door. I was extremely calm and told him.

"I have some words for you, my older brother."

He turned around and replied with a nod, "You just say."

"I just have a few words, yet they are difficult to express. My older brother, those savages, may all eat humans. But then some of them changed their minds and stopped eating people. They desired to be decent and develop into real people. Some of them were still eating people. Some, like worms, evolved into fish, birds, and monkeys, and finally to humans. Some worms did not wish to be good, and they are still worms today. As a result, persons who eat human flesh are ashamed of themselves in comparison to others who do not eat human flesh. But far less than the humiliation of those worms become monkeys.

Yi Ya steamed his son, then presented him to Jie and Zhou. It was a long time ago. Who knows how many people have been eaten since Pangu created the universe, including Yi Ya's son, Xu Xilin, and the people captured by Wolf Village. Last year, the blood of the executed inmates was likewise dipped with a steamed bun by a TB patient.

They're going to eat me. You couldn't even imagine it before. But why did you join them? What are those human-eating creatures afraid of? They'll eat me, and they'll eat you as well. They even eat each other in their group. But if they take a step back and alter themselves immediately, everyone will be pleased. Even though this has always been the case, we can be really good today, say no! I know you can say no. I heard you say no when the peasant begged for his rent to be released the day before yesterday."

He sneered at first, but then his eyes turned angry. His cheeks turned pale when I revealed their secret. Some individuals stood outside the door and crept in, including Richard Cho and his dog. I couldn't see some of their faces since they were hidden behind masks; some of them are still horrified, sneaked. I know they were a group, and they all ate people. However, I can tell the difference between them. Some of them assumed it was always this way, thus eating people was right. Some of them were aware that eating humans is wrong, but they continued to eat. They were afraid that others would reveal them. So they are quite furious and chuckle after hearing my words.

This time, my older brother's face is harsh and he says loudly,

"Get away! Just a crazy person!"

I now know one more thing about their brilliance. They were not only  unwilling to change, but they also had a plan. They were going to label me as mad. So, if they eat me afterwards, they will not only be okay, but also sympathised. Eating a villain, as that peasant put it. This is their age-old ploy!

Chen Laowu walked fiercely towards me. But they couldn't close my mouth, so I just said to them.

"You can start changing right now if you use your true heart! You should be aware that there will be no room for human-eating people in the future.

If you are unwilling to change, you will consume everything. Even if you have a large number of offspring, they will be exterminated by real people, just as the hunter killed the wolf, and the worms!"

I may just mindlessly consume some of my sister's flesh, and now it's my turn...

I've been eating humans for four thousand years. Although I was unaware of it, I now realize how difficult it is to see real people.

...

Are there any kids who have never eaten people?

Save the kids...

Chen LaoWu forced all of those people away. I had no idea where my older brother was. Chen LaoWu persuaded me to return to my room. The room is really dark. The beams and rafters all trembled on my heads; after a while, they grew large and piled on me.

I couldn't move because it was so heavy. He wanted me to die. I knew his heaviness was a deception, so I stumbled out, sweating profusely. But I just had to say.

"You must start changing right now if you use your true heart! You should be aware that there will be no room for human-eating people in the future..."

## Chapter 11

There isn't a sun in the sky. The door is shut. I eat two meals every day.

As I reached for my chopsticks, I began to think about my elder brother. I was aware that he was the cause of the death of my younger sister. My younger sister was five years old at the time. I could still picture her adorable appearance. He told my mum not to cry even though she was unable to stop crying. Due in part to the fact that he ate himself, whenever he cried, it indicated regret. But if he did feel bad,

My big brother ate my little sister, but I wasn't sure if my mother was aware of it.

But I believed my mother was aware. But she remained silent as she sobbed, perhaps believing it was acceptable. I can recall being around 4 or 5. I sat in front of the hallway and took pleasure in the chill. My older brother told sons to slice up some of their meat and boil it for their parents if they were ill. That produced an excellent man. My mother didn't object. A piece is edible, and the entire is also inherently edible. But I still feel sad when I recall how much she cried that day. That is very odd!

## Chapter 12

I cannot think anymore.

I just realized that I had been living in a place where people have been eaten for four thousand years. My older brother was in charge of the family and my sister recently passed away. He might not have added anything to the meal and fed us quietly.

I may just mindlessly consume some of my sister's flesh, and now it's my turn.

I've been eating humans for four thousand years. Although I was unaware of it, I now realize how difficult it is to see real people.

## Chapter 13

Are there any kids who have never eaten people?

Save the kids...

April, 1918.
